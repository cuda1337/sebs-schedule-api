## Priority Features

### 1. Staff Call-Out Monitoring
**Integration Options:**
- **Gusto API Integration**: Monitor PTO requests and sick leave submissions
- **Microsoft Office Email Monitoring**: Parse emails for call-out notifications
- **Teams Chat Extension**: Extend current webhook to handle staff messages

**Implementation Notes:**
- Similar webhook structure to client cancellations
- Parse messages like "John Smith called out sick today"
- Create staff override records in database
- Update schedule display to show staff unavailability

### 2. Infrastructure Upgrades

#### Permanent Webhook URL (Replace ngrok)
**Options:**
- Deploy API to cloud service (Heroku, Railway, DigitalOcean)
- Use webhook services (Webhook.site, ngrok pro)
- Set up custom domain with SSL certificate

#### Website Deployment (Vercel)
**Plan:**
- Deploy React frontend to Vercel
- Configure environment variables for API endpoints
- Set up custom domain if needed
- Configure build/deployment pipeline

### 3. Enhanced Scheduling Conflict Detection
**Status:** ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
**Completed:**
- Multi-staff conflict detection (max 2 staff per client)
- Override mechanism for intentional conflicts
- Visual feedback for conflict states
- Change log tracking for all modifications

**Remaining Work:**
- Staff double-booking prevention
- Location capacity constraints
- Advanced conflict resolution suggestions

**Implementation Example:**
```javascript
// Current implementation for client conflicts:
if (existingClientAssignment && !overrideClientConflict) {
  const clientAssignmentCount = await prisma.assignment.count({
    where: { versionId: version, day, block, clientId }
  });
  if (clientAssignmentCount >= 2) {
    return res.status(400).json({ 
      error: 'Client already has the maximum of 2 staff members assigned' 
    });
  }
  return res.status(400).json({ 
    error: 'Client already has a staff member assigned',
    requiresOverride: true,
    existingStaffCount: clientAssignmentCount
  });
}
```

### 4. Multi-Day Cancellation Support
**Message Format Examples:**
- "Jamie Chen canceled June 5-7"
- "Taylor Martinez out June 10 through June 15"
- "Cameron White canceled this week"

**Implementation Plan:**
- Extend date parsing to handle ranges
- Create multiple override records for date ranges
- Update frontend to show multi-day cancellations
- Add bulk operations for efficiency

### 5. Teams/Email Notifications for Lunch Schedule
**Status:** PLANNED
**Purpose:** Automatically notify staff when lunch schedules are finalized or modified

**Technical Implementation Options:**

#### Option 1: Microsoft Teams Webhook (Recommended)
```javascript
// When schedule is finalized:
const notifyTeams = async (schedule, finalizedBy) => {
  const webhookUrl = process.env.TEAMS_LUNCH_WEBHOOK_URL;
  
  const message = {
    "@type": "MessageCard",
    "themeColor": "0076D7",
    "summary": "Lunch Schedule Finalized",
    "sections": [{
      "activityTitle": "🍽️ Lunch Schedule Finalized",
      "facts": [
        { "name": "Location:", "value": schedule.location },
        { "name": "Date:", "value": formatDate(schedule.date) },
        { "name": "Finalized by:", "value": finalizedBy },
        { "name": "Groups:", "value": `${schedule.timeBlocks[0].groups.length} groups` }
      ],
      "text": "The lunch schedule has been finalized and is ready for staff."
    }]
  };
  
  await fetch(webhookUrl, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(message)
  });
};
```

**Message Appearance:**
- Shows as webhook message (not from specific user)
- Appears in designated channel (e.g., #lunch-schedules)
- Can include rich formatting and action buttons
- Clear attribution showing who finalized

#### Option 2: Email Notifications (SendGrid/AWS SES)
```javascript
const sendFinalizationEmail = async (schedule, recipients) => {
  const msg = {
    to: recipients, // ['supervisor@sebs.com', 'kitchen@sebs.com']
    from: 'noreply@sebs.com',
    subject: `Lunch Schedule Finalized - ${schedule.location}`,
    html: generateLunchScheduleHTML(schedule),
    text: generateLunchScheduleText(schedule)
  };
  
  await sgMail.send(msg);
};
```

#### Option 3: Power Automate Integration
- Trigger Power Automate flow on finalization
- Can perform multiple actions (Teams, Email, Calendar)
- Most flexible but requires Flow setup

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add to finalize/unlock endpoints in lunchSchedule.routes.js
- Store notification preferences per user/location
- Include full schedule details in notification
- Handle notification failures gracefully
- Consider adding "View in App" links
